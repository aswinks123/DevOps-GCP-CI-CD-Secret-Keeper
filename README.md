# DevOps-GCP-CI-CD-Secret-Keeper

**Project Summary:**

Our project is a comprehensive solution for secure secret management and efficient access control. It is built around a containerized Python application that stores sensitive data in a Redis database, allowing authorized users to retrieve secrets using generated access codes. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the project:

**Technology Stack:**

Python: The core of our application is written in Python, offering flexibility and ease of development.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): We leveraged GCP's infrastructure and services for robust and scalable cloud-based solutions.
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): The application is deployed on GKE, providing a managed Kubernetes environment for efficient container orchestration and scaling.
Docker: Our application is containerized, which ensures consistency and ease of deployment.
Git: Version control with Git is used to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a well-organized codebase.
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment): We established a CI/CD pipeline using GCP Cloud Build and other CI/CD tools. This pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment processes, reducing manual intervention and enhancing code quality.

**Key Features:**

Secret Management: The application focuses on secure secret storage and retrieval, ensuring that sensitive information is well-protected.

Access Control: Access to secrets is granted through generated codes, enhancing security and control over who can retrieve data.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): We used IaC tools to define and provision the underlying infrastructure, making deployments consistent and repeatable.

Scalability and Resilience: Our design ensures that the application can handle increased workloads and recover gracefully from any failures.

Cost Management: We actively managed project costs by using GCP's billing and cost optimization features to control expenses and maximize ROI.
