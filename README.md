# DevOps-GCP-CI-CD-Secret-Keeper

## Project Summary

Project is a comprehensive solution for secure secret management and efficient access control. It is built around a containerized Python application that stores sensitive data in a Redis database, allowing authorized users to retrieve secrets using generated access codes.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** The core of our application is written in Python, offering flexibility and ease of development.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** We leveraged GCP's infrastructure and services for robust and scalable cloud-based solutions.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** The application is deployed on GKE, providing a managed Kubernetes environment for efficient container orchestration and scaling.
- **Docker:** Our application is containerized, which ensures consistency and ease of deployment.
- **Git:** Version control with Git is used to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a well-organized codebase.
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** We established a CI/CD pipeline using GCP Cloud Build and other CI/CD tools. This pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment processes, reducing manual intervention and enhancing code quality.

## Key Features

1. **Secret Management:** The application focuses on secure secret storage and retrieval, ensuring that sensitive information is well-protected.
2. **Access Control:** Access to secrets is granted through generated codes, enhancing security and control over who can retrieve data.
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** We used IaC tools to define and provision the underlying infrastructure, making deployments consistent and repeatable.
4. **Scalability and Resilience:** Our design ensures that the application can handle increased workloads and recover gracefully from any failures.
5. **Cost Management:** We actively managed project costs by using GCP's billing and cost optimization features to control expenses and maximize ROI.
